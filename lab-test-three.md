# Lab Test Three: Async & Thread Pools

**Course:** Advanced Object-Oriented Programming  
**Duration:** 30 minutes  
**Total Marks:** 10

---

## 🎯 Goal
Implement a background task in Spring Boot using a custom thread pool to handle concurrent operations efficiently.

---

## 📝 Tasks

### 1. Enable Async Support
- Create a Spring Boot application.
- Add `@EnableAsync` to your main application class.

### 2. Configure Thread Pool
Define a custom `Executor` bean to manage threads (instead of using the default unbounded pool).
- **Core Pool Size:** 2
- **Max Pool Size:** 2
- **Thread Name Prefix:** "LabWorker-"

### 3. Create Async Task
Create a service with a method annotated with `@Async`.
- The method should accept a task ID (int).
- **Logic:**
  1. Print: `"Start Task " + id + " on " + Thread.currentThread().getName()`
  2. Sleep for 1 second (`Thread.sleep(1000)`)
  3. Print: `"End Task " + id`

### 4. Run & Verify
Call the async method **3 times** from a `CommandLineRunner`.

**Expected Output:**
You should see tasks starting on different threads (e.g., `LabWorker-1`, `LabWorker-2`) without waiting for previous tasks to finish.
